/**
 * Wraps `drizzle-kit generate` and strips the hardcoded `"public".` schema
 * qualifier drizzle-kit bakes into generated DDL (CREATE SEQUENCE, and every
 * FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES clause) regardless of the generating
 * connection's search_path.
 *
 * Why this matters: table CREATE statements are correctly left unqualified
 * by drizzle-kit (relying on search_path), but sequences and FK references
 * are NOT — they're hardcoded to whatever schema was "current" when
 * `generate` ran (always "public" here). That inconsistency is harmless in
 * normal production use (everything lives in "public" anyway, so explicit
 * and implicit resolution agree), but it silently breaks schema-based test
 * isolation: a fresh isolated test schema's FK constraints would validate
 * against the real "public" tables instead of the isolated schema's own
 * tables, either failing outright (see the `_luma_test_*` schema having no
 * matching row in `public`) or, worse, succeeding against the wrong data.
 *
 * Fixed once here, at generation time, rather than as a runtime SQL
 * transform in migrate.ts — the checked-in migration file is simply correct
 * and schema-agnostic from the start; no second code path needed to apply
 * it, matching this repo's "one migration mechanism" principle.
