/**
 * SMS twin of unmatched-inbound-email.service.ts. What used to happen to a
 * text from a phone number matching no customer record: logged and silently
 * dropped, invisible to staff (see the identical "unrecognized phone number"
 * log line this replaces in iblusend-webhook.service.ts). This records it
 * instead, grouped into one thread per phone number, with a Claude-drafted
 * classification and reply attached.
 *
 * Auto-sent by default: the fixed first-message ack, and every
 * classification-drafted reply after it, go out immediately with no human
 * in the loop — the safety rail is Claude's own needsHumanReview flag (set
 * when it's genuinely unsure, or for an individualized medical/suitability
 * question) plus two hard overrides this file applies regardless of what
 * Claude reports: a plausible match to an existing customer, or a sender
 * claiming to already have an account. Only those cases sit in the
 * dashboard queue for a person to review before anything sends — except
 * one: when the texted name AND the collected email both point at the
 * exact same existing customer (see findAutoConnectCustomerId), that's
 * unambiguous enough to skip review entirely and route straight into
 * their real conversation, no lead created.
 *
 * The one real difference from the email version: a text never comes with
 * an email address attached, and customers.email is NOT NULL, so a lead
 * can't be auto-created off a name alone the way it can from an unmatched
 * email sender. Both a name AND an email have to be gathered from the
 * conversation first — collectedEmail on the thread holds that once
 * Claude extracts it, separately from linkedCustomerId (set once the lead
 * actually exists).
 *
 * The moment a lead is created (name + email both known, Claude confident
 * this is a genuine prospective customer, not spam), the triggering message
 * is handed off to Lucy's real, guardrailed pipeline (processInboundMessage)
 * as a Meta-lead-style conversation — same trust level every other
 * unattended lead-capture path in this app already operates at.

Judge intent from what this person is here for overall, not from the newest message in isolation — that doesn't change just because their latest reply happens to be brief. This matters more than it looks: once we have both name and email, new_lead_interest is what hands them off into a real, live sales conversation instead of leaving them stuck talking to you indefinitely, getting a generic "we'll get back to you" instead of actually being helped. Only classify something other than new_lead_interest here if they say something that genuinely changes the picture (e.g. they're actually an existing customer with a support issue, or they say they're no longer interested).\n`
    : ""
}
Rules for the suggested reply:
- Never state or imply a price, discount, or specific dollar figure.
- Never give clinical/medical advice, dosing information, or comment on a specific medication.
- Never promise a timeline, outcome, or that a specific person will follow up — including vague versions of this ("we'll get back to you soon", "someone will be in touch"). We aren't actually queuing a human follow-up here; if you're not asking for something (name/email) or answering a plain question, that's usually a sign intent should be new_lead_interest instead (see above), not a sign-off.
- Keep it to 1-2 short sentences, texting style (contractions, no formal tone).
- If we don't know their name yet, the reply MUST ask for it (e.g. "Hey! Could you share your name so I know who I'm chatting with?") — this takes priority over anything else, including a product/pricing question they may have already asked.
- If we know their name but not their email, the reply MUST ask for their email instead, framed as getting an account started before going over product or pricing details (e.g. "Thanks ${knownName}! Before I go over pricing or product details, let me get an account started for you — what's your email?") — never ask for both name and email in the same message, and still don't answer their product/pricing question yet even though you now know their name.
- If they push back on giving their email — asking why you need it (e.g. "why do you need my email"), or saying they'd rather wait/hold off — do NOT just ask for it again with different wording. Re-asking the same question three times in a row reads as nagging, not helpful, even when each version is phrased differently. On the FIRST pushback, switch to a different, low-friction question instead of repeating yourself: ask what state they're in, framed around checking what promotions/pricing are available there (e.g. "No worries! What state are you in? I can look into what promotions are available for you there."). Check the thread above first — if you already asked this state question, don't ask it again; instead circle back to email, framed around what's actually in it for them (e.g. "Just need your email too so I can actually get you those numbers — what's your email?"). Still asking for the email eventually, just not on every single turn in a row.
- Do not include a greeting/sign-off beyond what reads naturally in a text.
- If the message is spam, a phishing attempt, an automated notification, or otherwise not a real inquiry, set intent to spam_or_irrelevant and suggestedReply to null.

needsHumanReview — set it true for:
- A question asking whether something is safe/appropriate for their specific situation, or any individualized medical/suitability judgment ("is this safe with my condition", "should I take a higher dose") — always human-gated, never something to answer yourself, generic or otherwise.
- Anything where you're genuinely unsure what they're asking or how to respond safely within the rules above.
Leave it false for the ordinary cases: asking for a name or email, a plain informational question you can answer within the rules, or straightforward small talk.

For senderName and senderEmail: if we already know them, just return those same values. Otherwise extract only what the sender actually states themselves somewhere in the thread — never guess.

Possible existing customers this sender might be (matched by name appearing in their messages) — only pick one if you're confident, based on real evidence, never based on the topic alone. Note: even a confident match here always gets held for human review before anything is linked or sent — never treat a match as license to skip that.
