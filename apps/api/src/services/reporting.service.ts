/**
 * Lead → questionnaire → purchase funnel, optionally scoped to a date
 * range. Each stage counts distinct customers, not events — a customer who
 * abandoned and later restarted the questionnaire is still one person in
 * "started," not two.
 *
 * True cohort funnel: the range picks a COHORT of leads (whoever's own
 * leadReceivedDate falls in it), and every later stage asks "did this ever
 * happen for someone in that cohort," not "did this happen within the
 * range." Earlier versions of this query scoped each stage by whichever
 * date column that stage's own event happened on — started by when the
 * questionnaire row was created, submitted by when it was last updated,
 * purchased by purchaseDate — which meant a customer could show up in
 * "purchased" this week for a questionnaire they'd submitted three weeks
 * ago, producing e.g. 0 submitted / 10 purchased in the same window even
 * though every one of those 10 purchases traces back to a real submission.
 * Scoping every stage to the same cohort instead guarantees each stage is a
 * subset of the one above it, the way a funnel actually reads.
 *
 * This makes `purchased`/`revenue` here answer a genuinely different
 * question than the Orders tab or Marketing CPA for the same range: those
 * scope by the purchase's own purchaseDate (period cash flow — "how much
 * came in this week"), while this tile scopes by the purchasing customer's
 * leadReceivedDate (cohort conversion — "how much has this week's cohort
 * generated so far, including sales that close after the window"). The two
 * are expected to disagree; that's not a bug to reconcile.
