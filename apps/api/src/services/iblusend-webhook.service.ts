// silently misses those real customers, which is exactly how a real
// inbound text from an existing customer went unanswered.

// Two customer records can legitimately share a phone number — e.g. an old
// test/lead signup left the same number on file as a since-purchased
// customer. Without a tiebreaker this matched an arbitrary row (whichever
// Postgres happened to return), which once sent a real customer's "thank
// you" reply to a stale unsold-lead record — Sarah's support conversation
// never saw it, and Lucy answered as if they hadn't purchased yet. Prefer
// whichever match already has a support conversation: per
// dispatchInboundMessage below, that only exists off a real purchase, so it
// identifies which of several same-number records this text actually
// belongs to today. Among ties, prefer the most recently created record.
