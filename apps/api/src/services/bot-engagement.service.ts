/**
 * Whether a lead's purchase followed at least one real reply to Lucy — SMS
 * or email, whichever channel they used — before the purchase date, not
 * just receiving the automated opener. "inbound" on both message tables
 * always means the customer wrote it (never Lucy's own text), so this is a
 * genuine two-way exchange, not just "a message was sent to them." Sarah's
 * post-purchase support conversations are deliberately excluded — asking
 * "did they talk to the bot before buying" about the bot that only ever
 * talks to people *after* they've already bought would be circular.
 *
 * Purchase date is a bare date (no time) and message timestamps are full
 * datetimes, so "before" is compared at day granularity — a reply on the
 * same calendar day as the purchase counts as before it.
