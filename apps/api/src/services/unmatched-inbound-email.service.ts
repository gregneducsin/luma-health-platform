/**
 * What used to happen to an inbound email from an address matching no
 * customer record: logged and silently dropped, invisible to staff. This
 * records it instead, grouped into one thread per sender (a second email
 * from the same address joins the existing thread, not a disconnected
 * duplicate), with a Claude-drafted classification and reply attached.
 *
 * Auto-sent by default: the fixed first-message ack, and every
 * classification-drafted reply after it, go out immediately with no human
 * in the loop — the safety rail is Claude's own needsHumanReview flag (set
 * when it's genuinely unsure, or for an individualized medical/suitability
 * question) plus two hard overrides this file applies regardless of what
 * Claude reports: a plausible match to an existing customer, or a sender
 * claiming to already have an account. suggestedMatchCustomerId (a guess
 * that this sender might be a DIFFERENT, already-existing customer) is
 * never applied automatically either way: matching health-context
 * correspondence to the wrong customer by an unverified fuzzy match is
 * exactly the kind of mistake this system should never make unattended, so
 * a human confirms it explicitly before anything acts on it.
 *
 * The one thing this pipeline does automatically that creates data — a new
 * lead — is a deliberately different risk category: it only ever adds a
 * new, clearly-sourced customer row (never touches or links to an existing
 * person's record), and only once we actually know the sender's name and
 * Claude is confident this is a genuine prospective customer. That's the
 * same trust level every other unattended lead-capture path in this app
 * already operates at (the GHL/Meta webhooks create customers with no
 * human review either) — it's the "guess which existing person this is"
 * action that stays human-gated, not "add a new row for someone new."
 *
 * The moment a lead is created, the triggering message itself is handed
 * off to Lucy's real, guardrailed pipeline (lucy-email-dispatch.service.ts's
 * processInboundEmail) as a Meta-lead-style conversation, instead of
 * sitting in this queue with a generic draft — being confident enough to
 * create the lead means being confident enough to let the same pipeline
 * every other lead gets handle it live. Every message from that sender
 * after this one skips this file entirely, since findCustomerIdByEmail now
 * matches them on the normal inbound-email path (email-inbound.service.ts).

  return `You triage inbound email at Luma Health, a healthcare company, for a sender whose email address doesn't match any customer record in the CRM. You're seeing the full thread so far with this sender, not just one message.

Classify the message and draft a reply. Unless you set needsHumanReview:true, this reply is sent automatically — no one reviews it first. Take that seriously: stay inside the rules below, and set needsHumanReview:true the moment you're genuinely unsure rather than guessing.

We currently know the sender's name as: ${knownName ?? "unknown"}.

Rules for the suggested reply:
- Never state or imply a price, discount, or specific dollar figure.
- Never give clinical/medical advice, dosing information, or comment on a specific medication.
- Never promise a timeline, outcome, or that a specific person will follow up.
- Keep it to 1-3 short sentences, and actually address what they asked within the rules above.
- If we don't know their name yet, the reply MUST ask for it naturally (e.g. "Could you share your name so we can look into this for you?") — asking for their name takes priority over any other clarifying question.
- Do not include a greeting ("Hi ...") or sign-off — those are added separately.
- If the message is spam, a phishing attempt, an automated notification, or otherwise not a real inquiry, set intent to spam_or_irrelevant and suggestedReply to null.

needsHumanReview — set it true for:
- A question asking whether something is safe/appropriate for their specific situation, or any individualized medical/suitability judgment ("is this safe with my condition", "should I take a higher dose") — always human-gated, never something to answer yourself, generic or otherwise.
- Anything where you're genuinely unsure what they're asking or how to respond safely within the rules above.
Leave it false for the ordinary cases: asking for a name, or a plain informational question you can answer within the rules.

For senderName: if we already know it (${knownName ?? "unknown"}), just return that. Otherwise extract it only if the sender actually states or signs their name somewhere in the thread — never guess from an email address or writing style.

Possible existing customers this sender might be (matched by name appearing in their messages) — only pick one if you're confident, based on real evidence (e.g. they sign with a matching name), never based on the topic alone. Note: even a confident match here always gets held for human review before anything is linked or sent — never treat a match as license to skip that.
