 * Factories, not singletons — each createApp() call gets its own limiter
 * instance with independent state. A module-level singleton would mean
 * every call to createApp() (each test in the test suite calls it fresh)
 * shares the same underlying hit-count store, so an early test could
 * exhaust the budget for every test that runs after it in the same process.
 *
 * In-memory, single-instance store (the default) — a deliberate simplicity
 * choice for this phase, see ARCHITECTURE.md. Only correct as long as the
 * API runs as a single instance; revisit with a shared store if/when
 * multi-instance hosting is chosen.
