 * exhaust the budget for every test that runs after it in the same process.
 *
 * In-memory, single-instance store (the default) — a deliberate simplicity
 * choice for this phase, see ARCHITECTURE.md. Only correct as long as the
 * API runs as a single instance; revisit with a shared store if/when

 *
 * Deliberately wider than the per-IP budget (10/15min) — this exists to
 * catch a distributed attack, not to be the everyday lockout mechanism, so
 * it shouldn't trip on a legitimate user who mistypes their password a
 * handful of times from one place (the per-IP limiter above already covers
 * that case tightly). Mounted on /login only — forgot/reset-password and
 * accept-invitation aren't password-guessing surfaces.
