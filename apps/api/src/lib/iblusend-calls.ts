/**
 * iBluSend's Calls API (FaceTime Audio, private beta) — a different origin
 * (https://iblusend.com/api/v1, "the app origin") from the plain messaging
 * endpoint in sms-provider.ts (api.iblusend.com/functions/v1), but the same
 * Bearer key (IBLUSEND_API_KEY) once calling is enabled on it.
 *
 * This only ever *prepares* a call — POST /api/v1/calls creates a five-
 * minute session and returns a confirmation_url. It never dials by itself:
 * a signed-in human must open that URL and press "Start call" for anything
 * to actually ring. That's iBluSend's own safety model (every call runs on
 * a real Apple ID), not a limitation to work around — this integration is a
 * click-to-call button, not an autodialer, by design.

 * A fresh Idempotency-Key per call: this fires once per "Call" button click,

 * one — retries of the *same* attempt (e.g. a network blip on our end)
 * would need to reuse the same key instead, but that's not the case here.
 *
 * line_id is omitted here on purpose — Luma's IBLUSEND_API_KEY now has a
 * default calling line bound to it directly in iBluSend's dashboard
 * (Settings → Developer → API Keys), which is what the docs mean by
 * "optional when the key has a default line." An earlier version of this
 * required an IBLUSEND_CALLING_LINE_ID env var and sent it explicitly, from
 * before that default was configured — no longer needed now that the key
 * itself carries one. If IBLUSEND_CALLING_LINE_ID is set anyway (e.g. a
 * second line added later without its own key), it's still honored.
