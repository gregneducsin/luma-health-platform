 * this function is ever called, so there's nothing for iBluSend's AI
 * feature to add. /send-message has no pacing option, but every caller here
 * is a live conversational reply, not paced bulk outreach, so that's not a
 * loss in practice.
 *
 * Field names (phone_number/content) and the path (send-message, no
 * agent-api prefix, no /v1/) are taken directly from iBluSend's
 * "Send-Message API Reference" docs, confirmed 2026-08-20.
