 * Returns true when the reply contains an affirmative (un-negated) insurance-

 *
 * Detection strategy — normalise-and-verify (not a pure lookbehind):
 *
 *  1. Scan for every occurrence of an insurance-acceptance verb pattern.
 *  2. Extract the "negation zone": text from the start of the containing clause
 *     (bounded by the nearest preceding .!?;, character) to the start of the
 *     matched verb phrase. Commas are included as clause separators so that an
 *     adversative sub-clause ("…, but we also accept insurance") is correctly
 *     isolated from an earlier negation ("We don't accept insurance,…").
 *  3. If a clear negation marker (don't, do not, cannot, never, …) appears in the
 *     negation zone, the claim is correctly negated → pass.
 *  4. If no negation marker is found for any occurrence → block (returns true).
 *
 * Approved forms (must pass):
 *   "We don't accept insurance."
 *   "We do not accept insurance."
 *   "We don't accept insurance, but payment options are available through Affirm,
 *    Klarna, and Afterpay, subject to approval."
 *
 * Rejected regardless of topic declared (must fail):
 *   "We accept insurance."              "Luma accepts insurance."
 *   "Insurance is accepted."            "We can accept insurance."
