/**
 * Approved objection-handling scripts for the abandoned-questionnaire outreach
 * workflow. Reviewed and approved by the business owner on 2026-08-15.
 *
 * Each objection follows a fixed three-stage sequence:
 *   Stage 0 → 1 (rebuttal):      one informational statement grounded in an
 *                                 approved knowledge topic, ending in a soft question.
 *   Stage 1 → 2 (secondAttempt): a direct close asking the customer to start
 *                                 the questionnaire now. Still one statement,
 *                                 one question — no re-arguing the same point.
 *   Stage 2 (standDown):         a plain, no-pressure close. No question asked.
 *                                 This is terminal — never a fourth attempt on
 *                                 the same objection in the same session.
 *
 * The reply/nextQuestion split mirrors ClaudeInteractiveResult: reply is the
 * statement, nextQuestion is the separate trailing question (safety.ts
 * validates that a "reply" action always carries exactly one nextQuestion,
 * and that a "pause" action — used for standDown — carries none).
 *
 * requiredTopics lists the knowledge-catalog keys (see knowledge-catalog.ts)
 * that must be declared in knowledgeTopicsUsed for the corresponding text to
 * pass interactivePostCheck's topic-gating.
 *
 * No database imports. No outbound messaging SDK imports.
