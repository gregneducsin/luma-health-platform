/**
 * Fixed, pre-approved follow-up nudges for a lead who clicked the intake
 * link but hasn't completed the Bask questionnaire yet. These are sent
 * automatically by the follow-up sweep, not drafted per-send by Claude —
 * proactive outbound check-ins don't have an inbound message to react to,
 * so there's nothing for the guardrail loop to validate against; the fixed
 * approved text is the guardrail here.
 *
 * Sequence: provider_check_in fires 2 hours after the click (if still
 * incomplete). If that send succeeds, intake_questions_check_in is
 * scheduled 1 hour after — relative to when the first one actually sent,
 * not a fixed offset from the click, so the "an hour later" promise holds
 * even if the sweep runs a few minutes late.
 *
 * Every template below is a small set of pre-approved variants, picked at
 * random (see pickVariant), not one fixed string — every lead getting the
 * exact same byte-for-byte sentence reads as templated. Every variant for a
 * given step still satisfies the same structural rules (checked in this
 * file's tests): one trailing question mark where a question mark is
 * expected, none where it isn't, no em dash, same required content (the
 * $20 offer, asking about state, etc).
