/**
 * Human-readable explanations for why a conversation got flagged
 * needsAttention — shared across all four dispatch pipelines (Lucy SMS,
 * Lucy email, Sarah SMS, Sarah email), since they all draw from the same
 * three situations (an unexpected error, a rejected/blocked draft reply, or
 * Claude/a pre-check routing the turn to staff) and largely the same set of
 * codes. A bare boolean flag on the dashboard told staff SOMETHING needed
 * attention but never what — this is the difference between "check every
 * flagged thread by hand" and "know what to look for before opening it."
 *
 * No database imports. No outbound messaging SDK imports.
